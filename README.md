# ml-sandbox

this is a repo of scripts, notes, utilities for my machine learning projects

## Setup

Pretty sure this is the guide i used for setting up my m1 mac: https://betterprogramming.pub/installing-tensorflow-on-apple-m1-with-new-metal-plugin-6d3cb9cb00ca

I've installed all my conda reqs to a env named `ldm`

```bash
conda activate ldm
```
